Examples
--


- **1 - Unimod_test1**.  Oscillation of 1 module. The parameters (amplitude, period and offset) are modify when the test button is pressed.

- **2** Unimod_test2: Oscillation of 2 modules. The phase difference is changed when the test button is pressed

- **3** wave: 9 independent modules are oscillation so that a wave is generated 

- **4** pp_test: Locomotion of the pitch-pitch minimal configuration. Press the test button for chaging the locomotion gait

- **5** pyp_gaits: Locomotion of the pitch-yaw-pitch configuration. Press the test button for changing the locomotion gait:  forward, sideways, rotating and rolling

- **6 - py6**: locomotion of a 6 module pitch-yaw snake robot
